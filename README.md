<h2>🚀 Introduction</h2>

This project a Java-based machine and room management system using Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation) for client-server communication and Java Swing for the graphical user interface. It demonstrates how different components of a system can communicate seamlessly over a network, while providing a user-friendly graphical interface.


<h2>✨ Features</h2>

- **RMI Communication:** Utilize Java RMI to enable remote communication between various components of the system.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The system provides a user-friendly interface created using Java Swing, making it easy to interact with and navigate.
- **Distributed System:** The application is designed as a distributed system, where different components can communicate with each other over a network.

<h2>🛠️ Technologies Used</h2>

- **🪄 Java:** Develop the application using Java, a versatile and widely-used programming language.
- **🌟 Java RMI:** Utilize Java RMI to enable remote method invocation and facilitate communication between distributed components.
- **✨ Java Swing:** Create a user-friendly graphical interface using Java Swing components.

<h2>🚦 Getting Started</h2>
